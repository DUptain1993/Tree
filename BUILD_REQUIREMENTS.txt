               TWRP RECOVERY BUILD REQUIREMENTS & ANALYSIS
================================================================================

CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS:
----------------------
Available Disk Space:    24 GB
Total RAM:               3.6 GB
Available RAM:           845 MB
CPU Cores:               8 (Good!)
Platform:                Termux on Android
Build Tools:             Not installed

TWRP BUILD REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------
Minimum Disk Space:      150 GB (TWRP source: 50-80 GB, Build output: 50+ GB)
Minimum RAM:             8 GB (16 GB recommended)
Minimum CPU Cores:       4 (8+ recommended)
Platform:                Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian)
Build Tools Required:
  - repo (Android source sync tool)
  - Python 3
  - Java JDK 11 or newer
  - build-essential (gcc, g++, make)
  - git, curl, wget
  - libncurses5, lib32z1, lib32ncurses5
  - And 50+ other dependencies

FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS:
---------------------
❌ Disk Space:   INSUFFICIENT (Need 150GB, have 24GB)
❌ RAM:          INSUFFICIENT (Need 8GB+, have 3.6GB with 845MB available)
✓  CPU Cores:    SUFFICIENT (8 cores is good)
❌ Platform:     NOT IDEAL (Termux can work but very limited)
❌ Build Tools:  NOT INSTALLED

VERDICT: Building TWRP directly on this device via Termux is NOT FEASIBLE
         due to insufficient disk space and RAM.

================================================================================
                        RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES
================================================================================

OPTION 1: BUILD ON A LINUX PC/LAPTOP (RECOMMENDED)
---------------------------------------------------
This is the standard and most reliable method.

Requirements:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS (or similar Linux distro)
- At least 150GB free disk space
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- Good internet connection (will download 50-80GB)

Steps:
1. Install build dependencies
2. Setup repo tool
3. Sync TWRP source code
4. Add your device tree
5. Extract kernel and vendor blobs
6. Build recovery image

See BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_PC.txt for detailed steps.

OPTION 2: GITHUB ACTIONS (FREE, CLOUD-BASED)
---------------------------------------------
Use GitHub's free cloud runners to build TWRP.

Advantages:
- Free for public repositories
- No local resources needed
- Automated builds
- 6 hours build time limit

Steps:
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Upload device tree
3. Configure GitHub Actions workflow
4. Trigger build remotely
5. Download recovery image

See BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_GITHUB.txt for workflow file.

OPTION 3: ONLINE BUILD SERVICES
--------------------------------
Use dedicated Android build services:

- https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-android-image-kitchen.2073775/
- CircleCI (free tier)
- GitLab CI/CD (free tier)

OPTION 4: REMOTE BUILD SERVER / VPS
------------------------------------
Rent a temporary VPS with sufficient resources:

Providers:
- DigitalOcean (Droplets)
- Linode
- Vultr
- AWS EC2 (free tier available)

Recommended specs:
- 4-8 CPU cores
- 16GB RAM
- 200GB storage
- Cost: $20-40 for one-time build

OPTION 5: USE ANDROID IMAGE KITCHEN (ALTERNATIVE)
--------------------------------------------------
Instead of building from source, you can:

1. Extract existing recovery from your device
2. Modify it using Android Image Kitchen
3. Repack and flash

This requires much less resources but offers limited customization.

================================================================================
                    WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
================================================================================

The device tree we created is complete and ready to use. You have two paths:

PATH A: PREPARE FOR PC BUILD
-----------------------------
1. Transfer the TREE directory to a Linux PC
2. Follow BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_PC.txt
3. Build TWRP recovery on the PC
4. Transfer recovery.img back to device
5. Flash using fastboot

PATH B: SETUP GITHUB ACTIONS BUILD
-----------------------------------
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload the device tree
4. Configure GitHub Actions workflow
5. Let GitHub build it for you in the cloud

Both methods will work. GitHub Actions is free and doesn't require local resources.

================================================================================
                      NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

I recommend using GITHUB ACTIONS (Option 2) because:
✓ It's completely free
✓ No local resources needed
✓ Automated and repeatable
✓ Can build while you do other things
✓ Build logs are preserved

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a GitHub Actions workflow file for building TWRP?
2. Provide detailed PC build instructions?
3. Create scripts to help extract kernel/vendor files from your device?

Let me know which option you'd prefer, and I'll provide detailed instructions!
